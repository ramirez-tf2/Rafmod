MSVC function-finding heuristics:
- funcs always start at 16-byte boundaries
- funcs often have 0xCC padding before they begin
- the sequence "push ebp; mov ebp,esp" virtually never happens except in func prologues


so, for longer funcs with proper stack frames:
- find a spot in the function body (e.g. a unique string reference)
- search backwards for "push ebp; mov ebp,esp": 55 8b ec


CTFBotMvMEngineerTeleportSpawn::Update
- unique string ref: "teleported_mvm_bot"
- backtrack to 55 8b ec
- sanity check: ptr to func should be found at vtable+0xb8

CTFBotMvMEngineerBuildSentryGun::Update
- unique string refs: "Built a sentry" "Placing sentry"
- backtrack to 55 8b ec
- sanity check: ptr to func should be found at vtable+0xb8

CTFBotMvMEngineerBuildTeleportExit::Update
- unique string refs: "Engineer.MVM_AutoBuildingTeleporter02"
- backtrack to 55 8b ec
- sanity check: ptr to func should be found at vtable+0xb8
